 <h1>The Hollywood Sign</h1>
 <h2>History on The Hollywood Sign</h2>
 <p>The Hollywood Sign was originally erected in 1923 as an advertisement 
    for a real estate development called "Hollywoodland.
     Each letter stood 30 feet wide and 50 feet tall,
     and the sign was lit up by 4,000 bulbs. As the development faded, the sign fell into disrepair. 
     In 1949, the city took control, removing the "LAND" and leaving the iconic "HOLLYWOOD" part. 
     Over the years, it has undergone several renovations, including a major one in 1978 where the sign was replaced with steel letters. 
     Today, the Hollywood Sign is a symbol of the entertainment industry and a famous landmark in LA.
